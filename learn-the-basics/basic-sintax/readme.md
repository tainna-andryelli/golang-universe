Principal concepts:

`package` - a way to group functions.

### Hello World

1. Create a hello directory 
2. Enable dependency tracking for your code
    
    command **go mod init** will create a go.mod file
    
    ```
    ➜  go mod init example/hello
    go: creating new go.mod: module example/hello
    ```
    
    The go.mod file is like a list that says:
    
        Which packages your project needs.
    
        Where to get those packages.
        
        What version of each package you are using.

    go.mod helps your Go project stay organized, and makes sure your code works the same for everyone, every time. 

1. Write some simple hello world code
    
    ```go
    //declare a main package
    package main 
    
    // import the fmt package which contains functions for formatting text
    import "fmt" 
    
    // A main function executes by default when you run the main package
    
    func main() {
    	// Print "Hello, world!" to the console
    	fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
    }
    ```
    
2. Call code in an external package 
    
    Make your printed message a little more interesting with "quote” package.
    
    We will **import "rsc.io/quote"**
    
    And use in **fmt.Println(quote.Go())**
    
3. Add new module requirements and sums.
    
    ```
    go mod tidy               
    go: finding module for package rsc.io/quote
    go: downloading rsc.io/quote v1.5.2
    go: found rsc.io/quote in rsc.io/quote v1.5.2
    go: downloading rsc.io/sampler v1.3.0
    go: downloading golang.org/x/text v0.0.0-20170915032832-14c0d48ead0c
    ```
    
    This will create go.sum file and change the go.mod file 
    
    The go.sum file is a safety checklist that makes sure the extra code your project uses hasn’t been changed or tampered with. ✅

1. Run your code to see the message generated by the function you're calling.
    ```
    ➜  go run .                           
    Don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating.
    ```
